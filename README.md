# Minecraft-Death-Sound-Player
Whenever you die in a singleplayer world, a random sound is selected from a list and played.

It opens latest log file and looks for things like "void" or "burned" and if there is a match of both words and syntax (so player writing burned will not play a sound) and plays random sound.

Make sure to add all of your sound paths to the folder where main.py is at. 

You can download sounds with: https://cobalt.tools
