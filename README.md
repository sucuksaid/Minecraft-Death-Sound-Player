# Minecraft-Death-Sound-Player
Whenever you die in a singleplayer world, a random sound is selected from a list and played.

It opens latest log file and looks for things like "void" or "burned" and if there is a match of both words and syntax (so player writing burned wont play a sound) and plays random sound.

Make sure to add all of your sounds to the folder where main.py is located at. And add all your sound paths to sounds list in main.py

You can download sounds with: https://cobalt.tools
